        The million dollar talk project was born from a simple challenge in a train from Evreux to Paris (France) between two friends, a commercial (John) and a web-developer (Edouard).<br/>
        The challenge was to make one million dollar if they let any people around the world, address a megainfo to someone.<br/>
        A megainfo is a 60 seconds simple message you write for someone, to announce your love, your wedding, a special gift for a birthday, a dinner invitation, a travel invitation, a job offer etc, and that is visible by the maximum amount of person at the same place, and the same time.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>What is the mechanism behind the idea?</b><br/>
        A simple page with three unique megainfos shown for 120 minutes.<br/>
        After publishing a megainfo, user is approximatively informed in how many time his message will be shown.<br/>
        The user must inform concerned people to visit The million dollar talk homepage, to see their megainfo.<br/>
        Each megainfo is only shown for 60 seconds, and will never be shown again, it is ephemeral.<br/>        
        Writing a megainfo potentially visible by the world only costs 0.99$.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>How themselves could establish the buzz?</b><br/>
        It is simple, while people concerned by your message visit The million dollar talk homepage, other people may be doing the same thing at the same time, so they will see your message for people you love.<br/>
        This is how the challenge could be met.
