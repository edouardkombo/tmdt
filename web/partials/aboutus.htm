    The Million Dollar Talk (#TheMillionDollarTalk or #TMDT) comes from a participative idea of crowdwriting: "<b>periodically publish an e-book containing some of our best publishers stories about casual sex experiences, or hookups with colleagues and other professions</b>".<br/><br/>
    As long as your story talks about sex with someone you are not in a serious dating romantic relationship with, you are welcome to share it in details... in every details!<br/><br/>

    We actually know very few details about sex frequency between professions, and inside our companies.
    The Million Dollar Talk will help studying our sexual behaviors, fantasies and matching, depending of our profession.
    The e-book will be published to everyone on the internet, we will moderate every message that will be published, to preserve the anonimity of concerned people.

    The Million Dollar Talk is an idea of Edouard Kombo, a Paris-based web developer, blogger, and John Tibere, a Paris-based accountant.<br/>
    Among other things, I study women social habits towards men and conversely, when it comes to fantasy, sex, or harrasment, especially in a professional environment.<br/><br/>

    The Million Dollar Talk is free and will always be free.<br/>
    Sharing a casual experience about colleagues or classmates is called <b>The Million Dollar Talk</b>.
