    The Million Dollar Talk (#TheMillionDollarTalk or #TMDT) is based on a fun and helpful idea: "<b>Free yourself from social pressure and immortalize anonymously, in an e-book, your hookups and one night-stands with colleagues or other professions like, dentist, plomber, fireman, nurse etc...</b>".<br/><br/>
    Why?<br/>
    We know very little about people real hookups stories in a professional environment, who they meet, when, how many times their relations last, what impact does this relation really has? 
    The easiest way to collect the maximum number of stories is to let the web builds a story and feeds it itself with other experiences.
    The periodic e-book is like a keepsake shared to the world, that some people who have contributed to, will keep forever, anywhere they are.<br/><br/>
    
    As long as your story talks about sex with someone you are not in a serious dating romantic relationship with, you are welcome to create a link from other messages and to share your own real experience in details!<br/><br/>
    The e-book will be published for free and periodically (per months or per weeks), to everyone talking the language of written stories, and every message will be moderated to preserve the anonimity of concerned people.
    To share your story, <a href="/">click here</a>. Stories will be posted online as they come in.<br/><br/>

    This project is an idea of Edouard Kombo, a Paris-based web developer, blogger, and John Tibere, a Paris-based accountant.<br/>
    Among other things, I study women social habits towards men and conversely, when it comes to fantasy, sex, or harrasment, especially in a professional environment.<br/><br/>

    The Million Dollar Talk is free and will always be free.<br/>
    Sharing a casual sex experience is called <b>The Million Dollar Talk</b>.
