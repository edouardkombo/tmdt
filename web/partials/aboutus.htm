        TMDT project was born from a simple challenge in a train from Evreux to Paris (France) between two friends, a commercial (John) and a web-developer (Edouard).<br/>
        Edouard launched a bet, if we let anybody send a short and ephemeral message that anyone in the world could see at the same time, we could make one million dollar, Three days later, the million dollar talk website was online.<br/>
        <br/><br/>
        <b>What is the concept?</b><br/>
        You write <b>for free</b> a short message (including links), that will be available for 60 seconds on the homepage, depending on current messages queues.<br/>
        Only three messages are available in the homepage at the same time.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Why?</b><br/>
        You can share humoristic messages, love messages, job offers, anything creative and positive.
