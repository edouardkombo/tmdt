    The Million Dollar Talk (#TMDT) project was born from a simple challenge between two friends in France, Edouard and John.<br/>
    They decided to let people express themselves anonymously, about their casual experiences with colleagues and classmates.<br/>

    Sharing a casual experience about colleagues or classmates is called <b>The Million Dollar Talk</b>.
